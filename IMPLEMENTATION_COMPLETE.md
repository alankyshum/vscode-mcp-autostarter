## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation ✅
- ✅ Extension project structure with TypeScript
- ✅ Basic MCP server configuration schema
- ✅ Main extension entry point with activation logic
- ✅ Basic server process management
- ✅ Configuration reading from VSCode settings

### Phase 2: User Interface ✅
- ✅ Tree View Provider for MCP servers with status indicators
- ✅ Context menu actions (start, stop, toggle auto-start)
- ✅ Status indicators and icons with theme colors
- ✅ Command registration and handlers
- ✅ Basic error notifications and user feedback
- ✅ Enhanced tooltips and server details webview

### Phase 3: Auto-start Functionality ✅
- ✅ Auto-start logic on extension activation
- ✅ Settings change monitoring and reaction
- ✅ Server health monitoring with 30-second intervals
- ✅ Retry logic for failed server starts (max 3 attempts)
- ✅ Logging and output channel with detailed information

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing ✅
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Unit and integration tests for core components
- ✅ Performance optimization and monitoring
- ✅ Enhanced documentation and README
- ✅ Input validation and configuration testing

### Phase 5: Advanced Features ✅
- ✅ Settings import/export functionality with JSON format
- ✅ Advanced server configuration UI with webview panel
- ✅ Backup and restore capabilities
- ✅ Enhanced configuration validation
- ✅ Advanced documentation with usage examples

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented
